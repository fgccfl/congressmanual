\subsection{Procedure Manuals and Officials}
\label{rule:authorities}

\subsubsection{Manuals}
At all FGCCFL tournaments, consult this manual first, 
followed by the most recent editions of 
\emph{NCFL Student Congress Manual} 
and 
\emph{Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised}.
Nonbinding guidance appears in {\footnotesize small print}; commentary appears in footnotes.


\subsubsection{Judges}
The Scorers (Parliamentarians at Grand Finals) may make rulings at the request of the \po. 
They generally should not intervene but may do so if necessary to correct major errors. 
Rulings made in the chamber \emph{will not} be overturned unless they directly contradict 
the written rules.

\subsubsection{Tournament officials}
The \cd\ and tab staff may make rulings at the requests of the Scorers or Parliamentarians. 
They may additionally issue rule interpretations or modifications and take any other actions they 
deem necessary to ensure fairness and efficiency.
Contestants should bring any concerns to their coaches, \emph{not} to the \cd.
