# FGCCFL Student Congress Manual
## Version 11 (2016-2017)

**If you're just looking for the manual**, the file you want is `congressmanual.pdf` above.

This repository includes *all* revisions made to Version 11 so that you can review the 
modifications. The raw source for the manual is in LaTeX format (a language designed for 
typesetting and advanced formatting) and is split among the documents in the `src` folder.

The version number that appears on the first page of the manual denotes the specific 
revision, always in the form 11.*x*.*y*, where a change in *x* indicates a substantive 
rule adjustment and a change in *y* denotes a technical correction.

Questions should be directed to Josh Schneider. Happy legislating!
