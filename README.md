This repository includes *all* revisions made to Version 11 so that you can review the 
modifications. The raw source for the manual is in LaTeX format (a language designed for 
typesetting and advanced formatting) and is split among the documents in the `src` folder. 
If you want to suggest a change or correction (via a pull request or otherwise), please 
do so using the raw source files.

The version number that appears on the first page of the manual denotes the specific 
revision, always in the form 11.*x*.*y*, where a change in *x* indicates a substantive 
rule adjustment and a change in *y* denotes a technical correction.

Questions should be directed to Josh Schneider. Happy legislating!
